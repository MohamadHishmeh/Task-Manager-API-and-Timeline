# Task-Manager-API-and-Timeline

## Description
The PERN Todo List is a simple and efficient web application built using the PERN stack (PostgreSQL, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows users to manage their daily tasks in an organized manner.

While this was a relatively simple project, I was able to build a REST API as well as learn a ton on server - client relationships! I plan to continue to improve and make the program more sophisticated.

## Key Features
- Create new tasks with customizable details, such as title, description, and due date.
- Mark tasks as completed or pending, helping you stay organized.
- Edit existing tasks to update their details or make changes as needed.
- Delete tasks that are no longer relevant or completed.
- View tasks sorted by priority, due date, or completion status, aiding in efficient task management.
- Responsive design ensures a seamless experience across devices.
